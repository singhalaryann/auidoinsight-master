            details: `The primary goal was to understand if there is a correlation between the number of boosters used and the total playtime for players who are in the early stages of the game (Arena 10 or below).

• Group A (Heavy Booster Users): Players who used ≥ 10 boosters on a given day
• Group B (Light Booster Users): Players who used < 10 boosters on a given day
• Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean playtime for Group A is the same as for Group B
• Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean playtime for Group A is different from that of Group B

To test this, we used Welch's t-test, which is suitable for comparing the means of two independent samples that may have unequal variances.`

We identified players at or below Arena 10 and determined the date they progressed beyond this point. Any data from after this "cutoff date" was excluded from the analysis for that user.

Next, we calculated the total boosters used per day and total playtime for each user, combining these datasets and filtering to include only relevant low-progression player activity.`

The script separated data into two groups and performed the statistical test with equal_var=False to use Welch's t-test methodology.

Results showed a T-statistic of 274.12 and P-value of 0.0, indicating strong statistical evidence that low-progression players who use 10+ boosters per day log significantly more playtime.`

Group A (>= 10 boosters): 145,233 players
Group B (< 10 boosters): 1,877,873 players

• Heavy Users: Players who used ≥ 10 boosters on a given day
• Light Users: Players who used < 10 boosters on a given day
• Null Hypothesis (H0): The next-day retention rate for heavy users is less than or equal to the rate for light users
• Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The next-day retention rate for heavy users is greater than the rate for light users

To test the difference between these two proportions, a two-proportion z-test was selected as the appropriate statistical method.`
