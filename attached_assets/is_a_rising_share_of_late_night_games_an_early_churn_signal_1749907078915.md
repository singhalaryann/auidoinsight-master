## 1¬†Business Question

> Does an _increase_ in a player‚Äôs **late‚Äënight play share** over the past 7‚ÄØdays predict **churn within the next 7‚ÄØdays**?

## 2¬†Key Definitions & Parameters

|Item|Definition|
|---|---|
|**Late‚Äënight game**|A round starting 00:00‚Äë04:59 server time.|
|**`ln_pct`**|Late‚Äënight games √∑ total games on a given day.|
|**`ln_pct_slope_7d`**|Ordinary‚Äëleast‚Äësquares slope of `ln_pct` across last 7‚ÄØdays (positive¬†= rising night‚Äëshare).|
|**Churn gap**|‚â•‚ÄØ14 consecutive silent days ‚áí churn.|
|**Early‚Äëchurn label**|`True` if churn starts ‚â§‚ÄØ7‚ÄØdays after the observation date.|
|**Study window**|2025‚Äë01‚Äë01¬†‚Üí¬†2025‚Äë04‚Äë01.|

## 4¬†Model Specification (Python¬†`statsmodels`)

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

import numpy as np

  

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ basic logistic model

X = df_1[['ln_pct_slope_7d', 'ln_pct', 'total_games']].astype(float) # Convert to float

X = sm.add_constant(X)

  

# Handle missing values

X = X.dropna()

y = df_1['churn_next_7d'].loc[X.index].astype(float) # Convert to float and align with X

  

logit = sm.Logit(y, X).fit()

print(logit.summary())

  

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ effect interpretation

slope_coef = logit.params['ln_pct_slope_7d']

odds_mult = np.exp(slope_coef)

print(f"Each +0.10 in 7-day slope multiplies churn odds by {odds_mult**0.10:.2f}")
```

- **Family:** Logistic (MLE).
    
- **Predictors:** recent slope, current late‚Äënight%, total games.
    
- **Sample size:** 2.82‚ÄØM user‚Äëdays.
    

## 5¬†Results

|Predictor|Œ≤ (coef)|Odds‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØper‚ÄØ+1.0|p‚Äëvalue|Interpretation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**`ln_pct_slope_7d`**|**+0.341**|**1.41√ó**|<‚ÄØ0.001|Faster rise in night‚Äëshare ‚Üë churn risk.|
|**`ln_pct`**|‚àí0.141|0.87√ó|<‚ÄØ0.001|Stable night‚Äëowls churn _less_.|
|**`total_games`**|‚àí0.0568|0.95√ó|<‚ÄØ0.001|More play volume is protective.|
|**Intercept**|‚àí0.994|‚Äî|<‚ÄØ0.001|Baseline.|

**Effect scale:** Each **+0.10** in `ln_pct_slope_7d` multiplies churn odds by **1.03** (‚âà‚ÄØ+3‚ÄØ%).  
**Model lift:** McFadden pseudo‚ÄëR¬≤¬†‚âà‚ÄØ0.045 (typical for churn models).

## 6¬†Interpretation

A _rising_ late‚Äënight share is an **early‚Äëwarning** signal: a 30‚ÄØpp/day climb (~20‚ÄØ%‚Üí90‚ÄØ%) lifts churn odds ‚âà‚ÄØ9‚ÄØ%. Conversely, players already playing mostly at night‚Äîbut not accelerating‚Äîare actually _stickier_.
