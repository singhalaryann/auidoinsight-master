#### Micro-copy Rules (Jobs-inspired)

1. **One idea per line.** No commas if a period works.
2. **Show action, not method.** “Go”, “Open”, “Deep Dive”.
3. **Drop techno-jargon.** Users know it’s statistical; say “Deep Dive” instead.
4. **Lowercase helper lines.** They whisper, titles speak.
5. **Brevity = confidence.**
