# UI/UX Product Requirements Document — “Dashboards That Listen”

## 1. Vision

*“Just ask.”* Every question reveals user intent and instantly reshapes the analytics experience—no menus, no filters, only answers.

## 2. Goals & Non‑Goals

### Goals

1. Deliver **role‑tuned dashboards** on first interaction.
2. Reduce **clicks‑to‑insight by 80 %** for pilot users.
3. Adapt dashboard & newsletter weighting continuously (< 1 minute latency).

### Non‑Goals

* Building a full BI tool; we layer on existing data sources.
* Manual widget builders; focus is automation.

## 3. Success Metrics

| KPI                                       | Target           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Avg. clicks from question to answer       | ↓ 80 %           |
| Weekly active dashboard users             | +35 %            |
| “Highly relevant insight” rating (survey) | 75 %             |
| Time spent in settings pages              | < 5 % of session |

## 4. Personas

| Persona           | Pain Today                                             | Desired Outcome                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Retention PM**  | Digs through funnels & SQL                             | See churn cohorts instantly                 |
| **Engagement PM** | Struggles to keep dashboards relevant as features ship | Auto‑updated engagement views               |
| **Exec**          | Overwhelmed by dozens of charts                        | One newsletter focusing on what matters now |

## 5. Key User Stories

1. **Ask & See** — “As a PM, when I type or speak a question, the main dashboard reorders to show the most relevant charts within 2 s.”
2. **Newsletter Shift** — “As my question mix changes over a week, the insight digest I receive on Monday adapts its section order automatically.”
3. **Zero Setup** — “As a new user, I can get a bespoke view without configuring any filters.”

## 6. Functional Requirements

### FR‑1 Universal Listener

* Capture questions from: in‑app search bar, Slack bot, voice command (beta).
* Store timestamp, user ID, raw text.

### FR‑2 Intent Engine

* Classify each question into ≥ 1 of 7 pillars (Engagement, Retention, Monetization, Store, UA, Tech Health, Social).
* Confidence ≥ 0.8; fallback to generic view.

### FR‑3 Dynamic Dashboard Composer

* Rank pillars per user (exponential decay over 14 days).
* Re‑order dashboard tabs, modules, and default filters on load.

### FR‑4 Personalized Insight Newsletter

* Weekly email assembled via template slots weighted by top 3 pillars.
* Minimum 1 chart / pillar; max 6 total.

### FR‑5 Continuous Adaptation

* On every new question, recalc scores and write to user\_profile table.
* Front‑end reads profile on each session start; background websocket pushes mid‑session updates.

## 7. UX Principles

1. **Zero‑friction** first mile: blank dashboard fades into view that “snaps” into shape after first question.
2. **Delight over clutter**: animate re‑ordering (200 ms ease‑in‑out).
3. **Explainability**: subtle tooltip “Why am I seeing this?” linking to last 3 questions that shaped it.

## 8. User Flow (Happy Path)

Landing → Ask Question → Intent Engine → Dashboard Morph → (Optional) Save View → End Session → Monday Newsletter

## 9. Edge Cases

* No classified intent → fallback “Explorer” view + nudge to ask another question.
* Conflicting intents (equal weight) → split‑view layout, ask user “Focus on X or Y?”

## 10. Technical Notes

* Front‑end: React + D3; WebSocket for live morphs.
* Back‑end: Python FastAPI; embeddings via OpenAI; Redis stream for event pipeline.

## 11. Analytics & Logging

* Log NPS after first 7 days.
* Instrument chart reorder timing and error events.

## 12. Open Questions & Risks

* Voice accuracy in noisy offices.
* Over‑personalization hiding critical metrics.
