# Slack Channel Access Fix

## The Problem
Your bot is authenticated but getting "channel_not_found" errors because it needs proper channel access.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Invite Bot to Channel
1. Go to your Slack workspace
2. Navigate to the channel where you want analytics responses
3. Type: `/invite @Analytics Assistant`
4. The bot will be added to the channel

### Step 2: Get the Correct Channel ID
1. Right-click on the channel name → "Copy Link"
2. Extract the channel ID from the URL (looks like C1234567890)
3. OR use the channel ID from where you invited the bot

### Step 3: Update Environment Variable (if needed)
If you want to use a different channel than your current one:
```bash
# Replace with your new channel ID
export SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C_YOUR_NEW_CHANNEL_ID
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration
1. Send a message mentioning the bot: `@Analytics Assistant what are our conversion rates?`
2. OR use the slash command: `/analytics what are our conversion rates?`

## Current Status
- Bot is properly authenticated with Slack ✓
- Bot token and signing secret are configured ✓
- Bot just needs channel access for responses ✓

## Alternative: Direct Message Testing
You can also test by sending a direct message to the bot in Slack, which doesn't require channel permissions.
