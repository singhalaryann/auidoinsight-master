# Final Slack Interactive Modal Setup

## Issue Resolved
The bot was returning HTML because responses weren't properly formatted as Block Kit JSON. This has been fixed.

## Current Status
- ✅ Slack bot authentication working
- ✅ Commands endpoint returning proper JSON Block Kit responses
- ✅ Interactive modal system implemented
- ✅ Fallback messaging uses structured blocks instead of HTML

## Final Configuration Required in Slack API Portal

### 1. Enable Interactivity (Critical)
1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps → Your Analytics Assistant app
2. Navigate to **Interactivity & Shortcuts**
3. Turn the toggle **ON**
4. Set Request URL: `https://audio-insight-dashboard-AviralChandra1.replit.app/slack/interactions`
5. Click **Save Changes**

### 2. Update Slash Command
1. Go to **Slash Commands**
2. Ensure `/analyse` command exists with:
   - Request URL: `https://audio-insight-dashboard-AviralChandra1.replit.app/slack/commands`
   - Description: `Open interactive analytics question wizard`

### 3. Reinstall App
1. Go to **Install App**
2. Click **Reinstall to Workspace**
3. Accept new permissions

## Expected Behavior After Setup

### With Proper Configuration
- Type `/analyse` → Interactive modal opens with text input and quick-start buttons
- Modal includes: conversion rates, user engagement, revenue analytics, retention analysis buttons
- Submit triggers AI analysis and dashboard updates

### Current Fallback (Development)
- Type `/analyse` → Structured message with guidance (not HTML code)
- Message includes formatted sections with analytics options
- User can mention bot directly for immediate questions

## Test Commands

After configuration, test in Slack:
1. `/analyse` - Should open modal (production) or show formatted guidance (development)
2. `@Analytics Assistant what are our conversion rates?` - Direct question processing

## Technical Verification

The endpoint now returns proper Block Kit JSON:
```json
{
  "response_type": "ephemeral",
  "text": "Hi! The interactive modal couldn't open right now.",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "*Available question types:*\n• Conversion & funnel analysis\n• User engagement metrics\n• Revenue & monetization data\n• Retention & cohort analysis"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures Slack renders structured messages instead of displaying HTML code.

## Next Steps
1. Enable interactivity in your Slack app settings
2. Reinstall the app in your workspace
3. Test `/analyse` command - you should see a formatted message or modal (not HTML)
4. The interactive modal flow will work once interactivity is properly configured
